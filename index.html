									<p>As an investment data consultant at Investgenics, my role involves analyzing financial data to develop investment strategies that will help clients achieve their financial goals. To mitigate risks, I diversify investments across different resources to maximize returns while minimizing risks. While stocks are the primary investment vehicle, investing in commodities like gold and oil has historically yielded excellent returns.</p>

									<p>The objective of this assignment was to help 2Market identify the most effective advertising channels by analyzing the data and exploring questions such as which social media platform (Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook) is the most effective method of advertising in each country, which platform is the most effective based on marital status, and which platform(s) seem to be the most effective per country. The analysis involved using SQL queries to join the relevant tables and gather insights based on the questions posed.</p>

									<p>The objective of this assignment is to analyse customer purchase behaviour data to determine which products sell the best and whether that varies based on demographic factors. The goal is to explore questions such as total spend per country, total spend per product per country, most popular products in each country, most popular products based on marital status, and most popular products based on the presence of children or teens in the home. The approach involves creating tables from the data files in PostgreSQL, importing the data, and using SQL queries to format, transform, validate, and analyse the data.</p>

									<p>As a data analyst working with 2Market, I conducted an analysis to help the global supermarket understand their customer purchase behavior. My analysis focused on understanding the demographics of their customers, identifying the most effective advertising channels, and determining which products sell the best and if that varies based on demographics.
										To support 2Market, I created a dashboard that includes key metrics such as average revenue from each marketing channel, to inform decision-making. This dashboard provided valuable insights to help 2Market optimize their marketing efforts and improve their bottom line.</p>

									<p>As a data analyst at a financial institution, I was tasked with investigating Bitcoin in a little more detail, particularly in terms of future growth of the currency and its use in the United States. The objective was to explore Bitcoin and its potential use and growth in the United States using two public APIs: the current Bitcoin Price Index and USA population data.</p>
